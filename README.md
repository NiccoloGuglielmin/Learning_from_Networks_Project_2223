# Learning_from_Networks_2223
 Repository that contains the code developed for the project for Learning from Networks 2022-2023 course at UniPD.
This project has been developed by:
- Guglielmin Niccolò
- Savio Andrea
- Zaccarin Angelo

To download the brain networks we analyzed download them in the project folder from the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zPdNVBV7rywWwuXsro8YIkwP7bRgR2O4?usp=sharing .

The code available in this repository is the one we runned exploiting Google Colaboratory machines which are based on a Linux system, platform Linux −5.10.133+−x8664−with−Ubuntu−18.04−bionic with already installed Python 3.7.15 .
You can find this code at the following link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19LI7jRGkT4kJ2gWvmsCQpLagh9Vbdd_a?usp=sharing .

To run it locally, follow these instructions:
- download the jupyter file;
- download and extract the data folder to have the brain networks;
- open the file jupyter;
- comment the first two command rows about the Google Drive mount;
- change the next two rows writing:
	- path_to_directory = "" #in this way you can use relative paths
	- data_directory = "data//" #data is the folder that contains the brain networks
- now you can run the notebook.
